// This file is intentionally kept as an empty module to avoid routing conflicts
// with the page located at /src/app/(app)/travel/page.tsx.
// The actual page component for the /travel route (within the (app) group)
// is served from /src/app/(app)/travel/page.tsx.

// IMPORTANT: If the routing conflict error persists after this change,
// you MUST MANUALLY DELETE this file (src/app/travel/page.tsx) from your project
// and clear your Next.js cache (delete .next folder and restart dev server).
