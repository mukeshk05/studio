// This file is intentionally kept minimal to resolve a Next.js routing conflict.
// The actual page for the /travel route is located at /src/app/(app)/travel/page.tsx.
// Ideally, this file (/src/app/travel/page.tsx) should be deleted from your project
// if src/app/(app)/travel/page.tsx is the intended page component.

export {}; // This ensures the file is treated as a module but exports nothing that defines a page.
